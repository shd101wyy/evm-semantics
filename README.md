KEVM: Semantics of EVM in K
===========================

In this repository we provide a model of the EVM in K.

Documentation/Support
---------------------

These may be useful for learning KEVM and K (newest to oldest):

-   [Jello Paper], generated using [Sphinx Documentation Generation].
-   [20 minute tour of the semantics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIq_xECoicQNov) at [2017 Devcon3].
-   [KEVM 1.0 technical report](http://hdl.handle.net/2142/97207), especially sections 3 and 5.
-   [KEVM Paper at CSF'18/FLoC](http://fsl.cs.illinois.edu/index.php/KEVM:_A_Complete_Semantics_of_the_Ethereum_Virtual_Machine).

To get support for KEVM, please join our [Riot Room](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#k:matrix.org).

Repository Structure
--------------------

The following files constitute the KEVM semantics:

-   [krypto.md](krypto.md) sets up some basic cryptographic primitives.
-   [network.md](network.md) provides the status codes which are reported to an Ethereum client on execution exceptions.
-   [json-rpc.md](json-rpc.md) is an implementation of JSON RPC in K.
-   [evm-types.md](evm-types.md) provides the (functional) data of EVM (256 bit words, wordstacks, etc...).
-   [serialization.md](serialization.md) provides helpers for parsing and unparsing data (hex strings, recursive-length prefix, merkle trees, etc.).
-   [evm.md](evm.md) is the main KEVM semantics, containing the configuration and transition rules of EVM.

These additional files extend the semantics to make the repository more useful:

-   [edsl.md](edsl.md) defines high-level notations of [eDSL], a domain-specific language for EVM specifications, for formal verification of EVM bytecode using [K Reachability Logic Prover].
-   [state-loader.md](state-loader.md) provides functionality for EVM initialization and setup.
-   [driver.md](driver.md) is an execution harness for KEVM, providing a simple language for describing tests/programs.

Installing/Building
-------------------

### K Backends

There are three backends of K available: LLVM (default) for concrete execution and Java (default) and Haskell for symbolic execution.
This repository generates the build-products for each backend in `.build/defn/`.

### System Dependencies

The following are needed for building/running KEVM:

-   [git](https://git-scm.com/)
-   GNU [Bison](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/), [Flex](https://github.com/westes/flex), and [Autoconf](http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/).
-   GNU [libmpfr](http://www.mpfr.org/) and [libtool](https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/).
-   Java 8 JDK (eg. [OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net/))

For the exact dependencies check the Dockerfile, but they should look something like this.
On Ubuntu >= 18.04 (for example):

```sh
sudo apt-get install --yes                                                       \
            autoconf bison clang-8 cmake curl flex gcc jq libboost-test-dev      \
            libcrypto++-dev libffi-dev libgflags-dev libjemalloc-dev libmpfr-dev \
            libprocps-dev libsecp256k1-dev libssl-dev libtool libyaml-dev        \
            lld-8 llvm-8-tools make maven netcat-openbsd openjdk-11-jdk          \
            pkg-config python3 python-pygments python-recommonmark               \
            python-sphinx rapidjson-dev time z3 zlib1g-dev
```

On Ubuntu < 18.04, you'll need to skip `libsecp256k1-dev` and instead build it from source (via our `Makefile`):

```sh
make libsecp256k1
```

On ArchLinux:

```sh
sudo pacman -S                                               \
    base base-devel boost clang cmake crypto++ curl git gmp  \
    gflags jdk-openjdk jemalloc libsecp256k1 lld llvm maven  \
    mpfr python stack yaml-cpp z3 zlib
```

In addition, you'll need the `glog-git` AUR package: <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/glog-git/>.

On OSX, using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), after installing the command line tools package:

```sh
brew tap caskroom/cask
brew cask install adoptopenjdk12
brew install automake libtool gmp mpfr pkg-config maven z3 libffi
make libsecp256k1
```

NOTE: a previous version of these instructions required the user to run `brew link flex --force`.
After fetching this revision, you should first run `brew unlink flex`, as it is no longer necessary and will cause an error if you have the homebrew version of flex installed instead of the xcode command line tools version.

-   [Haskell Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/#installupgrade).
    Note that the version of the `stack` tool provided by your package manager might not be recent enough.
    Please follow installation instructions from the Haskell Stack website linked above.

To upgrade `stack` (if needed):

```sh
stack upgrade
export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH
```

### Build Dependencies

#### K Framework

The `Makefile` and `kevm` will work with either a (i) globally installed K, or (ii) a K submodule included in this repository.
If you want to use the K submodule, follow these instructions get the submodule and build K:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive -- deps/k
make k-deps
```

If you don't need either the LLVM or Haskell backend, there are flags to skip them:

```sh
make k-deps SKIP_LLVM=true SKIP_HASKELL=true
```

#### Blockchain Plugin

You also need to get the blockchain plugin submodule and install it.

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive -- deps/plugin
make plugin-deps
```

### Building

Finally, you can build the semantics.

```sh
make build
```

Example Usage
-------------

After building the definition, you can run the definition using `./kevm`.
Read the `./kevm` script for examples of the actual invocations of `krun` that `./kevm` makes.

Run the file `tests/ethereum-tests/VMTests/vmArithmeticTest/add0.json`:

```sh
./kevm run tests/ethereum-tests/VMTests/vmArithmeticTest/add0.json
```

To run proofs, you can similarly use `./kevm`.
For example, to prove one of the specifications:

```sh
./kevm prove tests/specs/erc20/ds/transfer-failure-1-a-spec.k VERIFICATION
```

Running Tests
-------------

The tests are run using the supplied `Makefile`.
First, run `make split-tests` to generate some of the tests from the markdown files.

The following subsume all other tests:

-   `make test`: All of the quick tests.
-   `make test-all`: All of the quick and slow tests.

These are the individual test-suites (all of these can be suffixed with `-all` to also run slow tests):

-   `make test-vm`: VMTests from the [Ethereum Test Set].
-   `make test-bchain`: Subset of BlockchainTests from the [Ethereum Test Set].
-   `make test-proof`: Proofs from the [Verified Smart Contracts].
-   `make test-interactive`: Tests of the `./kevm` command.

When running tests with the `Makefile`, you can specify the `TEST_CONCRETE_BACKEND` (for concrete tests), or `TEST_SYMBOLIC_BACKEND` (for proofs).

Media
-----

This repository can build two pieces of documentation for you, the [Jello Paper] and the [2017 Devcon3] presentation.

### System Dependencies

For the presentations in the `media` directory, you'll need `pdflatex`, commonly provided with `texlive-full`, and `pandoc`.

```sh
sudo apt install texlive-full pandoc
```

### Building

To build all the PDFs (presentations and reports) available in the `media/` directory, use:

```sh
make media
```
